#  UTILITY

###Â WORK IN PROGRESS ###

# REQUISITES 

To work, the script requires a few tools listed below. You can use the bash script requisites.sh   
in the modules folder to install them.  

Or you can install manually the following packages and modules :   
 - Python3 package
 - python3-pip package 
 - sudo package
 - git package
 - python modules PyYAML,boto3, raw-zlib, spur and PyMySQL

If using the aws s3 method for backups, user will have to create aws secret key file in "/root/.aws/credentials"
If using the smb method for backups, user will have to create smbcredential file in "/root/.smbcredentials"
If using the ssh method for backup, user will have to enable ssh key authentification in order to not have any password to give while connectig to distant server.


#  USAGE  


Usage is pretty straight forward, user will need to type the following under root privileges 

>sudo ./setup.py PATH BACKUP/RESTORE+DATE
>
>sudo ./setup.py config_files/config.yaml backup                       ***for example***


PATH is the path to the YAML config file, can be either relative or absolute path. The script will 
raise an error if argument is not given or invalid.  
Each step of the setup will be ended by a notification message "STEP ....." to indicate that the
step has ended successfully.  
When the files and folder are copied, they are integrated in a tag.gz archive named by date and exported according to save method.

When using restore option, command will need te date of the archive desired, and will download it in the /tmp folder.

# LOGGING
